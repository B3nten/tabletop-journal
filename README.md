# Notescroll

## Intro

Notescroll is a (soon to be collaborative) note taking application for tabletop and role playing gamers. It's purpose is to provide a structured framework for recording gameplay sessions, world lore, and keeping track of inventory and events in a fast and simple way.

The goal is that Notescroll 'gets out of the way' when you are playing a game. Creating and editing documents should not distract you from the gameplay, but still offer enough advanced features to be preferable to a word document or notepad.

## Goals

* Structured system with features tailored for tabletop / role playing games
* Fully featured on both desktop and mobile
* UX optimized for speed of note taking, navigation
* Can be used collaboratively or individually
